# NLP-for-Climate
This is a project developed for the course "Automated Text Processing for Social Sciences" taught by Ali Hürriyetoğlu

# Problem statement
As the increasing heat patterns in the world become hazard and disaster events, actions or policies are needed to protect lives, livelihoods, and assets. However, heatwaves and ways to prevent their socio-economic-ecological-demographic effects are often neglected by the public and policymakers. Therefore, there is a need for more research and “documentation” (ENBEL, 2023), especially regarding the actions to prevent harm and damage. So, the visibility of heat wave mitigation actions, plans, and policies must be enhanced to increase awareness among decision-makers, provide guidance, and propose policy solutions.  

# Research objective
This study will first establish a corpus from the “documents and publications” related to heatwave hazards.  Then, the BERT Topic technique will be utilized on this corpus to identify the impacts of heat waves alongside actions for mitigation & adaptation observed in the corpus. The study will use the coherence score to evaluate the relevance of the topics. 

The main research questions that will guide this objective are:
•	How to establish a corpus using documents aiming to mitigate the impacts of heat waves?
•	How to identify the topics/characteristics from the documents?
•	How can these documents inform the development of comprehensive heat wave mitigation strategies for policymakers?
